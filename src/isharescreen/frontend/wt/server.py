"""WebTransport bridge server.

aioquic provides QUIC + HTTP/3 + WebTransport. We accept HTTP CONNECT
with `:protocol = webtransport` on a single endpoint (`/wt`), serve the
viewer page on `GET /`, and per WT session:

  - Open one unidirectional stream PER ENCODED FRAME from server to
    client. (Per-frame stream isolates head-of-line blocking — a lost
    or slow stream affects only its frame.)
  - Accept one bidirectional stream from client carrying JSON input
    events (mouse, key, scroll).

Multi-viewer fan-out: one iss `Session` + one libx264 encoder produce
encoded NALU bytes once per frame; the bytes are written to every
active WebTransport session in parallel.

The handshake puts the cert SHA-256 fingerprint in the URL so the
browser passes it to `serverCertificateHashes` and skips CA validation.

# QUIC streams have NO cross-stream ordering guarantee, so the browser reorders
# video by `seq` (the order the AUs were forwarded = the native decode order)
