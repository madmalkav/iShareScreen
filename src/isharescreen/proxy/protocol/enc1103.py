"""enc1103: Apple's bespoke RFB control-channel stream cipher.

After non-SRP / SRP authentication the server emits a `1103` encoding entry
containing 32 cipher-text bytes ECB-wrapped under the auth-derived key. We
unwrap to a 16-byte AES key + 16-byte CBC IV; from then on every RFB control
message in either direction is framed and AES-128-CBC encrypted with a
counter-keyed SHA-1-160 tag. NOTE: this is **plain SHA-1**, not HMAC —
the tag is `SHA1(u32_be(counter) || plaintext-before-tag)` (see
`encrypt_message`). The "HMAC" naming below was a misnomer.

Wire format on the encrypted channel:

    u16 BE  ciphertext_length
    bytes   ciphertext      (multiple of 16)

Plaintext payload inside the cipher block:

    u16 BE  msg_length
    bytes   msg
    bytes   pad             (zero pad to 16-byte alignment after the 20-byte mac)
    bytes   mac             (plain SHA1(u32_be(counter) || everything-before-mac); NOT HMAC)

A record's ciphertext is at most 65,520 bytes (the largest multiple of 16 a
u16 can hold), so its body is at most 65,498 bytes. A longer message goes out
as full records and then the rest; the receiver concatenates them (the
remotex notes, "Records").

Counter is per-direction, starts at 0, increments on each successful decrypt
or each encrypt. Decryption tolerates a small lookahead window because Apple
sometimes pipelines a re-key reply before the previous decrypt's counter has
been consumed.
